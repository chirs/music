And now we come to the real technical trick that underlies "It's Gonna Rain":
What we are hearing are two identical tape loops playing at the same time. 
There's one in the left ear and one in the right. 
But one of those loops is running ever so slightly faster than the other.
...
Brian Eno has likened this process to a moirÃ© pattern, where two simple identical geometrical patterns are superimposed to give rise to something much more complex than the original.
